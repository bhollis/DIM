# DIM Tools

These are some random helpful tools for DIM development. In general, it's better to use the [Destiny Sets Data Explorer](https://destinysets.com/data) though.

To use these, run `yarn install` inside `tools/`, and then run any of the tools directly:

* `API_KEY=<your api key> ./getBungieManifest.js` will download the latest D1 manifest.
* `API_KEY=<your api key> ./getD2Manifest.js` will download the latest D2 manifest.
* `./manifestDig.js` will allow you to search through a manifest for values.
